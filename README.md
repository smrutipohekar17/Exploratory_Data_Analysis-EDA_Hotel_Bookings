# Hotel Bookings Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on hotel bookings. The project aims to analyze a dataset of hotel bookings to gain insights into various aspects such as booking patterns, guest demographics, market trends, and room allocation discrepancies. By conducting EDA, we aim to provide valuable insights that can inform business decisions and strategies for the hotel industry.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to conduct an in-depth analysis of hotel booking data to gain insights into various aspects of bookings, guest demographics, market trends, and booking patterns over time. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), we aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the dataset that can inform business decisions and strategies for the hotel industry.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**:
   - Import necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib).
   - Read the dataset (`hotel_bookings.csv`) into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Handle missing values and remove invalid rows.
   - Eliminate duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.

2. **Descriptive Analysis**:
   - Explore statistical properties of key features (e.g., lead time, total special requests, average daily rate).
   - Use visualizations to understand distributions and relationships between variables.
   - Investigate data types, memory usage, and overall structure of the dataset.

3. **Spatial Analysis**:
   - Analyze home countries of guests using a choropleth map.
   - Identify countries with highest number of guests and explore regional trends.

4. **Room Type Analysis**:
   - Examine relationship between reserved and assigned room types.
   - Visualize room type allocation across different booking scenarios.

5. **Market Segment Analysis**:
   - Investigate distribution of bookings across market segments (e.g., online travel agencies, direct bookings).
   - Identify dominant booking channels and their impact on overall bookings.

6. **Booking Patterns Over Time**:
   - Analyze total number of guests arriving each day over time.
   - Visualize guest arrivals using line plots or time series analysis techniques.

7. **Distribution Analysis**:
   - Explore distribution of guest arrivals to understand spread and variability of bookings.
   - Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) to characterize the distribution.

## Conclusion

Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis, this project provides valuable insights into various aspects of hotel bookings. These insights can inform strategic decision-making processes for hotel management, marketing teams, and business stakeholders. Further analysis and modeling may be warranted based on the findings of this exploratory phase.
